    <p>
        It's not a real barbecue until a dish of baked beans shows up! 
        While there are many different versions and many different techniques, 
        I'm here to tell you that these are the best.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound dried red beans</li>
        <li> 3 quarts water</li>
        <li> 1 bay leaf </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 pound boneless pork should, cut into 2-inch cubes(Optional)</li>
        <li> 1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup package light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            step 1
            Add dry beans to a bowl, cover with water, and let soak for 8 hours, or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2
            Drain beans and transfer to a large pot filled with 3 quarts of cold, fresh water. 
            Add bay leaf, pork shoulder, and onion. Bring to a simmer over high heat. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and stir. 
            Skim off foam if desired. Let simmer until beans are just tender, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 3
            While beans simmer, combine barbecue sauce, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, molasses, 
            mustard, Worcestershire, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper, kosher salt, 
            and garlic powder in a bowl with a whisk. Set aside until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            step 4
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 5
            Transfer tender bean mixture to a deep, 15x10-inch baking dish using a spider strainer. 
            Pour in barbecue sauce mixture and 2 Â½ cups of the bean cooking liquid. Place bacon slices on top
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 6
            Bake uncovered in the center of the preheated oven 
            until the liquids have reduced into a thick sauce, 2 to 3 hours.
        </li>
    </ol>
